# LeetCode_Problems

Leetcode Questions are sorted by Easy, Medium, Hard, and other special topics, such as database, shell, or concurrency. Within each folder, I've labeled solutions to my problems by the problem titles as they are on LeetCode.com within the folder they're organized as on the site. Problems from other sites may also appear here, also organized in their own folders.

I've included the prompt and examples in the files which will have the filetype of whatever language I've chosen to solve the problem in. Notes, if applicable are also within the comments.

I put my solutions out publicly on my github so I can track my own progress and growth as I become a better programmer. I hope likewise, that if you happen to see them, you can learn from my shortcomings and successes as well! Happy LeetCoding!

Update: Most may not have the prompts, but all problems done are free ones available on Leetcode.com. It ended up taking too long to reflect/write prompts on each and every problem, and imposed on my own practicetime. Apologies o_o.
